  Data Integrity (ecdsa-rdfc-2019 issuers)
    Gen: P-256
      ❌ "before all" hook for "When expressing a data integrity proof on an object, a proof property MUST be used."
  ecdsa-rdfc-2019 (create)
    ecdsa-rdfc-2019 (issuers) VC 1.1
      Gen: P-256
        ❌ "before all" hook for "The (proof) type property MUST be DataIntegrityProof."
  Data Integrity (ecdsa-rdfc-2019 verifiers) VC 1.1
    Gen: P-256
      ❌ When deserializing to RDF, implementations MUST ensure that the base URL is set to null.
      ❌ Conforming processors MUST produce errors when non-conforming documents are consumed.
      ❌ If either securedDocument is not a map or securedDocument.proof is not a map, an error MUST be raised and SHOULD convey an error type of PARSING_ERROR.
      ❌ If one or more of proof.type, proof.verificationMethod, and proof.proofPurpose does not exist, an error MUST be raised and SHOULD convey an error type of PROOF_VERIFICATION_ERROR
      ❌ The type property MUST contain the string DataIntegrityProof.
      ❌ If expectedProofPurpose was given, and it does not match proof.proofPurpose, an error MUST be raised and SHOULD convey an error type of PROOF_VERIFICATION_ERROR.
      ❌ The proofValue property MUST be used, as specified in 2.1 Proofs.
      ❌ ("proof.proofValue") A string value that contains the base-encoded binary data necessary to verify the digital proof using the verificationMethod specified. The contents of the value MUST be expressed with a header and encoding as described in Section 2.4 Multibase of the Controller Documents 1.0 specification.
      ❌ Implementations that use JSON-LD processing, such as RDF Dataset Canonicalization [RDF-CANON], MUST throw an error, which SHOULD be DATA_LOSS_DETECTION_ERROR, when data is dropped by a JSON-LD processor, such as when an undefined term is detected in an input document.
      ❌ The value of the cryptosuite property MUST be a string that identifies the cryptographic suite. If the processing environment supports subtypes of string, the type of the cryptosuite value MUST be the https://w3id.org/security#cryptosuiteString subtype of string.
