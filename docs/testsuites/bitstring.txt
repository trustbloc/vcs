  Data Model: BitstringStatusList Entry
    Gen
      ❌ Any expression of the data model in this section MUST be expressed in a conforming verifiable credential as defined in [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0].
      ✓ If present, the id value is expected to be a URL that identifies the status information associated with the verifiable credential. It MUST NOT be the URL for the status list.
      ✓ The type property MUST be BitstringStatusListEntry.
      ✓ The purpose of the status entry MUST be a string.
      ✓ The statusListIndex property MUST be an arbitrary size integer greater than or equal to 0, expressed as a string in base 10.
      ❌ The statusListCredential property MUST be a URL to a verifiable credential.
      ❌ When the URL is dereferenced, the resulting verifiable credential MUST have type property that includes the BitstringStatusListCredential value.
  Data Model: BitstringStatusList Credential
    Gen
      ❌ "before all" hook for "When a status list verifiable credential is published, it MUST be a conforming document, as defined in [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]."
  Algorithm
    Gen
      ✓ If an implementation of any of the algorithms in this section processes a property defined in Section 2. Data Model whose value is malformed due to not complying with associated "MUST" statements, a MALFORMED_VALUE_ERROR MUST be raised.
  Algorithm: Generate Algorithm
    Gen
      ❌ "before all" hook for "The following process, or one generating the exact output, MUST be followed when producing a BitstringStatusListCredential."
  Algorithm: Validate Algorithm
    Gen
      ✓ The following process, or one generating the exact output, MUST be followed when validating a verifiable credential that is contained in a BitstringStatusListCredential
  Algorithm: Bitstring Generation Algorithm
    Gen
      ❌ "before all" hook for "The following process, or one generating the exact output, MUST be followed when generating a status list bitstring."
  Algorithm: Bitstring Expansion Algorithm
    Gen
      ✓ The following process, or one generating the exact output, MUST be followed when expanding a compressed status list bitstring.
  Algorithm: Processing Errors
    Gen
  Interop
    ✓ Gen should verify Gen
