  Background:
    Given Organization "test_org" has been authorized with client id "f13d1va9lp403pb9lyj89vk55" and secret "ejqxi9jb1vew2jbdnogpjcgrz"

  @e2e_ldp_jwt_sdjwt_success
  Scenario Outline: Store, retrieve, verify and revoke credential using different kind of profiles (LDP, JWT, SD-JWT).
    Given   V1 New verifiable credential is issued from "<credential>" under "<issuerProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"
    And   V1 verifiable credential is verified under "<verifierProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"
    Then   V1 verifiable credential is successfully revoked under "<issuerProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"
    Then we wait 3 seconds
    And   V1 revoked credential is unable to be verified under "<verifierProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"

    Examples:
      | issuerProfile                    | verifierProfile      | credential                      |

  @e2e_ldp_jwt_sdjwt_revoke_err
  Scenario Outline: Unsuccessful attempt to revoke credential from wrong issuer (LDP, JWT, SD-JWT).
    Given   V1 New verifiable credential is issued from "<credential>" under "<issuerProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"
    And   V1 verifiable credential is verified under "<verifierProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"
    Then   V1 "<wrongIssuerProfile>" did unsuccessful attempt to revoke credential for organization "test_org"
    And   V1 verifiable credential is verified under "<verifierProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"

    Examples:
      | issuerProfile                    | wrongIssuerProfile              | verifierProfile      | credential                      |
      | i_myprofile_ud_P256k1/v1.0       | i_myprofile_ud_es256_jwt/v1.0   | v_myprofile_ldp/v1.0 | certified_mill_test_report.json |
      | i_myprofile_ud_es256k_jwt/v1.0   | i_myprofile_ud_es256_sdjwt/v1.0 | v_myprofile_jwt/v1.0 | permanent_resident_card.json    |

  @e2e_ldp_jwt_sdjwt_verify_format_err
  Scenario Outline: Credential verification failed due to unsupported credential format by verifier (LDP, JWT, SD-JWT).
    Given   V1 New verifiable credential is issued from "<credential>" under "<issuerProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"
    And   V1 verifiable credential with wrong format is unable to be verified under "<wrongVerifierProfile>" profile for organization "test_org"

    Examples:
      | issuerProfile                    | wrongVerifierProfile | credential                      |
      | i_myprofile_ud_P256k1/v1.0       | v_myprofile_jwt/v1.0 | certified_mill_test_report.json |
