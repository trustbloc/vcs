  Scenario Outline: OIDC credential issuance and verification Auth flow
    Given Profile "<issuerProfile>" issuer has been authorized with username "profile-user-issuer-1" and password "profile-user-issuer-1-pwd"

    And Profile "<verifierProfile>" verifier has been authorized with username "profile-user-verifier-1" and password "profile-user-verifier-1-pwd"


    When User interacts with Wallet to initiate credential issuance using authorization code flow with client registration method "<clientRegistrationMethod>"
    Then credential is issued
    Then User interacts with Verifier and initiate OIDC4VP interaction under "<verifierProfile>" profile with presentation definition ID "<presentationDefinitionID>" and fields "<fields>"
    And Verifier with profile "<verifierProfile>" retrieves interactions claims
    Then we wait 2 seconds
